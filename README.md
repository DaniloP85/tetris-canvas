# Tetris - JS, HTML and CSS only

![](readme/git_completo.gif)

## Description

The idea is to return to the simplest and most basic programming.

At work I do a lot of system integration, not root programming, that which needs to have logic involved, so in my free time I challenge myself to make games.

This time I made a version of Tetris, it was hard work because I didn't use any framework to facilitate the construction, I also didn't use AI, I did it face to face and with courage.

It took a lot of work and refactoring to get this result.

I was thinking about a differentiator of the very popular game, I was studying Firebase a lot and I found it interesting to use it here in this project, as I didn't need to create a whole infrastructure to have a real-time connection with several users, in fact I wanted one for broadcast, where all users could see each other's scores, in real time, Firebase gives me this easily.
